// The original single definition loaded replies on EVERY comment fetch — including
// root comment lists — which made those queries much heavier than necessary.
// Use commentWithAuthor for lists; commentWithAuthorAndReplies only when you need
// the reply count or shallow preview (e.g. findById for the standalone GET endpoint).
